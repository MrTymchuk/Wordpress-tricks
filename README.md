# A collection of Wordpress tricks, hacks and snippets
This is my personal collection of different Wordpress tricks, hacks and snippets, used in various projects. Rather than keeping them to my self I'd rather share them with you, and I encourage you all to use/change/alter/optimize where those are due.

## Snippets

- days-old.php - a small hack to hide an article/post date after X days
- single-{slug}.php - a function (place in functions.php) that introduces single templates on a category level.
